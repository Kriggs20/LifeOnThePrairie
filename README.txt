Life on the Prairie

Author: Kyle Riggs

Outline: This project is much like Conway's Game of Life, but there are several animals interacting with one another on the grid. There are Foxes, Badgers, Rabbits, Grass spaces, and Empty spaces that fill up the grid that you use or customize yourself.

Application: A lot of Inheritance and Polymorphism are used in this project. There is an Animal class that is the parent of each unique animal listed above. This holds their basic functionalities, while of course their specific classes expands on each animals rules and abilities. Also, there is a Plain class that initializes the game board (prairie) and sets up everything for the game to begin. Rabbits will eat grass, Foxes will eat Rabbits, and the animals will try and reproduce to spread offspring.
